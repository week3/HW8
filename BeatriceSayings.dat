Oh, big stud! Always running around to gallivant with your fillies!
Remember, don't sit too close to the TV, it will make you cruel!
You know, I was beautiful before I had you.
I'm sorry, did you need a compliment?
Oh, this letter I have? It's from the government saying I'm proud of you!
Oh no, what I'm holding is nothing.
Well, look who finally decided to pick up the phone.
The t-shirt told me to 'Just Do It.' I don't know what 'it' refers to!
I will not be spoken to in that tone by an article of clothing!
You don't know how lucky you are to have me!
You can fill your life with projects, books, movies and your little girlfriends, but it won't make you whole.
You're BoJack Horseman, there's no cure for that!
When are you going to come visit me? And bring me some carrot cake.
You could be thin.  Just go easy on the sweets, and when you go somewhere, don't walk, gallop!
You know, nobody gives a damn what you feel!
Don't believe all that crap all your big Hollywood agents tell you.
You know, I remember when your father Butterscotch first saw you after you were born -- he thought you'd have a racing career.
You're just like your father.
This rest home is a shit hole. Don't forget that I was heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cube fortune and I'm accustomed to a certain lifestyle.
I forget, did I have another child besides you?  Or was that just a wish?
So did that vending machine I bought you work out? Or did you wash down every carrot with beer?
Why doesn't Butterscotch come visit me?
Are you still hanging around with those same loser friends of yours?
You're so lucky to have had me as your mother. My own mother was never the same after her lobotomy...
I remember when you thought you'd try playing football. You didn't have the haunches for it.
I should have married Corbin Creamerman instead of your father. How my life would have been different...
Everything they serve here at the nursing home tastes like moldy hay.
Are you playing a video game right now?
You know, my parents never let me eat ice cream. They only let me have sugar coated lemon wedges.
Are you still playing with sea horses?
