25
Mother, why are you such a bitch?
You know, I remember when you tried to drown me in the bathtub when I was 22!
Do you need me to donate blood for you again?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Dammit, mother! Why do you keep bringing that up?
Mother, Butterscotch has been dead for years.
Oh, that's just a bunch of crap!
You're full of shit!
Do you need your teeth filed? Your tongue has certainly gotten sharp!
You know, I might call you more often if you'd say nice things to me!
Nag, nag, nag!
Oh, geez.  Give it a rest!
Dammit, don't you have anything nice to say?
Have you been drinking?
Why can't you be proud of my acting career?
I don't mean to be indelicate, but when was the last time you were de-wormed?
Are you taking your medications?
You know, eating hay might help keep your regular.
Did the glue factory people stop calling you?
Saying things like that hurts my feelings...
Have you ever even watched my TV show?
Don't make fun of my seahorses!
It's not like when I was a child and had sea monkeys...
You know, I am not a LOSER! I played Secretariat!!!
No, I don't sound like Mr. Ed! He WAS a LOSER!
